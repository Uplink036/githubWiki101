# githubWiki101

## Introduction

Ever wondered about hosting information other than just code on github? So have i, here are some options on how to do just that. We are going to cover 
- Github // <- You are here  
- Linking to other repos
- Github wiki

And this is going to end with a short conclussion about my opinon after working with each of them for a bit. 

## Prerequisites

This assumes some level of familarity with github and markdown, but some things will be explaind as we go along. 

# Github 

Github supports markdown (.md) as a way to communicate with other people you're working with. It is quite feature rich, some of which you can find [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

The most useful ones headings which you write like 
```Markdown
# A first-level heading 
## A second level heading 
### A third level heading 

```
> Github - writing and syntax 

There are also some stylings, my most commonly used are: 
| Style | Syntax | Result | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Italic | \*text\* | *text* |
| Bold | \*\*text\*\* | **text** | 
> Github - writing and syntax

Github also supports links. You can link to...
- ... a webpage 
- ... a place in the current document
- ... a file or folder in the current repo 
- ... a local or online image, which will be displayed in place. 

## Folders 
While this works great for one document, to be a proper wiki you need to be able to have multiple pages. This could mean multiple markdown files, but github also supports folders, meaning we can organize our pages in a relativly easy way. 

Let's go to [workshops](./Workshops)
