## Introduction

Ever wondered about hosting information other than just code on GitHub? So have i, here are some options on how to do just that. We are going to cover 
- [Github](#introduction) // <- You are here  
- [Linking to other repos](#folders)
- [Github wiki](#github-wiki)

And this is going to end with a short [conclussion](#how-to-contribute) about my opinon after working with each of them for a bit. 

## Prerequisites

This assumes some level of familarity with GitHub and markdown, but some things will be explained as we go along. 

# GitHub 

GitHub supports markdown (.md) as a way to communicate with other people you're working with. It is quite feature rich, some of which you can find [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

The most useful ones headings which you write like 
```Markdown
# A first-level heading 
## A second level heading 
### A third level heading 

```
> GitHub - writing and syntax 

There are also some stylings, my most commonly used are: 
| Style | Syntax | Result | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Italic | \*text\* | *text* |
| Bold | \*\*text\*\* | **text** | 
> Github - writing and syntax

Github also supports links. You can link to...
- ... a webpage 
- ... a place in the current document
- ... a file or folder in the current repo 
- ... a local or online image, which will be displayed in place. 

## Folders 
While this works great for one document, to be a proper wiki you need to be able to have multiple pages. This could mean multiple markdown files, but GitHub also supports folders, meaning we can organize our pages in a relativly easy way. 

Let's go to [workshops](./Workshops)

# GitHub wiki 

GitHub also supports a wiki, which is a way to organize information in a more traditional way. It is a bit more limited in what you can do, but it is also a bit easier to use.

In my experince this was awkward to use, and I would not recommend it. Subfolders are not supported, and it is not as easy to navigate. It does have a decent webinterface, especially for viewing the wiki, but it is not as easy to edit. The way to work on it locally is also a bit awkward, and it is not as easy to work on it with other people. Especially if you are going for the wiki feel. The best example i could find of this is [here](https://github.com/tajmone/github-tests/wiki/).

However, there are other alternatives. One recomended to me and seems to be a good way to keep track of things is from the open source community. Which can be found [here](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/wiki/ORT-Community-Meeting)


# How to contribute

GitHub is a good platform for sharing and collaborating on code, but it is not a good platform for sharing information. It is not designed for it, and it shows, but can work. 

A major pro is that it's easy for a lot of people to work on and is releated to what we in the software world are doing. I.e., no fancy tools needed. 

With a good set of rules in the repositories and guides on how to contribute, it can be very powerful and flexible. We could also use features of GitHub which we as students don't come into contact with, but may be useful. Such as organizations on GitHub, which is also the way I'd recommend doing this.

These are my thoughts on the different options, but I am sure there are more. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
