Each folder can support it's own root file, which is like a home page for that area. These are, by default, README file and by clicking on a markdown file, you will also be able to see the contetns of that file on the web.

- lists all the files in the folder
- links to the files in the folder
- lists all other materials, such as other github repos, websites, etc.
